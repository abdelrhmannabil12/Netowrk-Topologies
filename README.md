## üß† Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide a **hands-on learning resource** for networking students and professionals preparing for certifications like:
- **CCNA 200-301**
- **CCNP ENCOR / SNCF (300-710)**
- **OT & ICS Network Security Fundamentals**

Each topology is organized, documented, and explained in a way that bridges **theoretical concepts** with **real-world configuration practices**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.x recommended).  
2. Review the `.docx` file for addressing tables and design notes.  
3. Apply configurations manually in the CLI or load the saved config.  
4. Test connectivity and analyze packet flow.
